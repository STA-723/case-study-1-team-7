#### Executive Summary

We study the association between exposure to Dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) and 12 Polychlorinated Biophenyl (PCB) members and premature delivery using observational study data. To address high correlation within PCB members that leads to unstable estimates in standard linear regression methods, we fit a logistic regression model that includes a weighted sum of standardized PCB levels instead of all PCB members, along with variable selection based on Lasso. We find evidence that higher exposure to both DDE and PCB is associated with higher odds of preterm delivery. Our result is relative robust in terms of influential points analysis and missing data imputation as suggested by the sensitivity analysis.

#### Introduction

Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and Polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) were proved to be toxic, leading to a ban on use in United States in 1972, 1978 respectively. We are interested in whether and how the DDE and PCB relate to risk of premature delivery adjusting other possible confounders such as physical background, demographic background and socio-economic status. 

Our data comes from a subsample of the US Collaborative Perinatal Project (CPP) conducted by Longecker et al. (2001), which contain the gestational age, PCBs and DDE (PCB and DDT decompositions in the serum), triglycerides and cholesterol (fat chemicals), and demographic characteristics such as race and socio-economic status. 

#### Materials and Methods

We consider a class of linear regression models that can model the linear association between the probability of preterm delivery and predictors of interest on some suitable scale. In particular, we consider a logistic regression model for its good interpretability, where the log-odds of premature delivery are modeled by a linear combination of DDE and PCB levels, adjusted for observed demographic predictors including race, age, and smoking status, and triglyceride and cholesterol levels. While binary logistic regression is a standard method in modeling categorical response, we suffer a loss of information on different delivery periods, which does contain information about different levels of risk on the infants' health. Therefore, we bin the gestational ages to reflect increasing levels of risk prescribed by NIH and also consider an ordinal logistic regression with an assumption that the odds corresponding to each of these levels are proportional. We discuss and fit both models below. 

The main challenge is high correlation between multiple PCB variables. High correlation between predictors in the regression is known to inflate standard errors of the estimated effects, so our inference on not only the PCBs, but also for other predictors, can be severely limited by adjusting for all of them. Two approaches are discussed. We can either take a weighted sum of PCB variables after standardizing them to the same scale, and adjust for this single variable as a proxy for "aggregated" PCB levels. Alternatively, we can use variable selection methods to exclude PCB variables that are deemed unimportant for the model, and re-fit the regression based on the selected variables only.  For the first approach, we consider a two-stage modeling process. We apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and consider the first prcincipal component as a predictor in the binary/ordinary logistic regression. For the second approach, we apply Lasso to select representatives for PCBs and refit the binary/ordinary logistic regression.

(The second challenge is modeling heterogeneity across different centers, which is important since the data show they can have widely different racial distribution. Commonly, a modeler decides to estimate the effect of center as fixed or random. By the former, the heterogeneity of center is modeled as a shift in the average response adjusted for the other variables, and is estimated using subjects only within the center. By the latter, it is modeled as a variance component between different centers that have a common underlying distribution, and is estimated using partial information from all subjects. )


#### Results

##### Exploratory Data Analysis

As shown in figure , the dataset contains 2380 observations, with over 90% having missing values on predictor `albumin`, around 22% having missing values on socio-economic indices and 1 observation with missing value on PCB level. We drop the variable albumin and keep the complete cases in terms of remaining variables. A sensitivity analysis is also conducted to addressing the problem. As shown in Figure , strong correlations exist among PCBs, which suggest a severe multicollinearity may exist among PCBs. Figure shows a heterogeneity across centers exist. Since different centers have distinct demographic background (such as race and income as shown in Figure), we assume each center cannot borrow information from others and consider fix effects for 12 centers instead of random effect. For simplicity and save the degree of freedom, we do not consider the interaction between center and other predictors.
